# Description
This study includes seven parts:

1. The abundance and diversity of the chicken gut microbiota reach a plateau at 7 DPH

2. RMP biases chicken gut microbiota development and microbial interactions

3. Ecological deterministic and stochastic processes shape the segment-specific community types

4. Chicken gut microbes have different colonization abilities

5. Co-occurrence networks reveal more positive associations among microbes in the chicken gut

6. Serum metabolite abundance changes with chicken development

7. QMP of gut microbiota establishes connections between microbes and chicken serum metabolites
